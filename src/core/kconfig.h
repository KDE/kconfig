 *
 * \brief The central class of the KDE configuration data system.
 *
 * Quickstart:
 *
 * Get the default application config object via KSharedConfig::openConfig().
 *
 * Load a specific configuration file:
 * \code
 * KConfig config("/etc/kderc", KConfig::SimpleConfig);
 * \endcode
 *
 * Load the configuration of a specific component:
 * \code
 * KConfig config("pluginrc");
 * \endcode
 *
 * In general it is recommended to use KSharedConfig instead of
 * creating multiple instances of KConfig to avoid the overhead of
 * separate objects or concerns about synchronizing writes to disk
 * even if the configuration object is updated from multiple code paths.
 * KSharedConfig provides a set of open methods as counterparts for the
 * KConfig constructors.
 *
 * See \l {https://techbase.kde.org/index.php?title=Development/Tutorials/KConfig}{the techbase HOWTO on KConfig}
 *
 * \sa KSharedConfig, KConfigGroup

     *
     * If CascadeConfig is selected, system-wide configuration sources are used
     * to provide defaults for the settings accessed through this object, or
     * possibly to override those settings in certain cases.
     *
     * If IncludeGlobals is selected, the kdeglobals configuration is used
     * as additional configuration sources to provide defaults. Additionally
     * selecting CascadeConfig will result in the system-wide kdeglobals sources
     * also getting included.
     *
     * Note that the main configuration source overrides the cascaded sources,
     * which override those provided to addConfigSources(), which override the
     * global sources.  The exception is that if a key or group is marked as
     * being immutable, it will not be overridden.

     * convenience definitions for the basic mode.
